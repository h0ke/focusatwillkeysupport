# focus@will Keyboard Support

### Install Instructions

 - Download the [focus@will zip file](https://github.com/h0ke/focusatwillkeysupport/archive/master.zip) and extract it.
 - Visit [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
 - Click 'Load Unpacked Extension'
  - If you don't see this option, check 'Developer mode'

Once the extension is installed, you'll need to **restart your browser**. This ensures each tab has the F2 listener running.
